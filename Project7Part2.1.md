# Project 7 Part 2.1 FCFS Queue Simulation - README

## Overview
This Python code simulates a **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS)** queuing system, calculating key metrics such as:
- **Service Start Times**
- **Service Finish Times**
- **Waiting Times**
- **Queue Lengths**
- **Time Average Number in Queue (L_q)**
- **Average Number in Queue as Seen by Arriving Customers (L_q(A))**

The system assumes that customers arrive sequentially and are served in the order of their arrival.

## Purpose
The main objective of this code is to:
1. Simulate the behavior of customers arriving at a service system, with each customer having a fixed **arrival time** and **service duration**.
2. Calculate various metrics based on the system's behavior, including the **waiting times** and **queue lengths** at each customer's arrival.
3. Compute the **time average number of customers in the queue** (\(L_q\)) and the **average number of customers in the queue as seen by arriving customers** (\(L_q(A)\)).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- **numpy**: for numerical operations
- **matplotlib**: for plotting results

## Output
To Terminal:
- **Service Start Times**
- **Service Finish Times**
- **Waiting Times**
- **Queue Lengths**
- **Time Average Number in Queue (L_q)**
- **Average Number in Queue as Seen by Arriving Customers (L_q(A))**
